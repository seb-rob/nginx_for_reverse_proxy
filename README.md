# NGINX FOR REAVER PROXY
## Steps
* Create an EC2 instance in cloud (aws)
* Setup nginx in EC2
```
sudo apt install nginx
```
* Start nginx
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
* Enable nginx
```
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
* Change your directory to /etc/nginx/sites-available
```
# in order to update default nginx configuration according to our requirement
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
```
* Open file available _default_ in directory
```
sudo vim default
```
* Make belo chages

# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/

# https://wiki.debian.org/Nginx/DirectoryStructure
#
# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.

* Test your configuration using below command
```
cd ~
sudo nginx -t
```
* If your test was successful reload engin
```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
* Check your EC2 with public IP.
